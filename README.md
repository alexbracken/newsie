# Newsie
A barebones, no-nonsense Python script for posting news stories to social media platforms. Designed for simplicity, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness, so journalists can focus on reporting.

  _Currently under active development. This script may or may not work and has not been tested extensively._

## Dependencies
- Python (tested on 3.14)
- Poetry (dependency management)
    - View pyproject.toml for full dependencies

## TODO

- Debug mode
    - Need a way to test Facebook API connection without posting

## Potential Enhancements

    - Calculate engagement rates by time, concentrate slots based on that model
